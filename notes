// app.use() is a middleware
// server: {
//     "/api": "http://localhost:3000", so any url which has /api will automaticallt detect localhost:3000 means it will append wherever /api will exist also it means request bhi aik hi jaga se a rhi ha
//   },
// proxy -> instead of creating a fixed url (like http:localhost) we use proxy
// axios have some additionality functionalitites thats why its better than fetch
// cors -> check origin i.e. set origins which are supposed to be allowed and which are not(can be url and path)

//its a bad practice to use run build and make a dist folder paste it into backend folder and then deploy

//Data Modeling -> models the data i.e. defines structure of data
// Before started creating database, first know what type of data will be stored in the database
// then create the data model
// now create the 'models' folder and then start creating the structures.
//mongoose will help u in creating schema

//to export schema -> we will use model to export
//model will take two things (kia model banaon, kis ki basis pr model banoan)

//type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectID
//ref: "name from where u r getting ur data"
